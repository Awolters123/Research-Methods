To run the Mileston5.sh script you must download the shellscript to your local machine an also download the rug_wiki text file, or another file that ends with '*.txt'. If you wish to download the rug_wiki.txt file from wikipedia itself. Here is the link: https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen. The rug_wiki.txt file in this repository has been edited. I've deleted the references at the end of the file, so don't forget to do that yourself if downloaded from wikipedia.

After that, follow the steps provided in the milestone5.sh script and you will be able to run the script succesfully.

Output of the milestone5.sh script on the rug_wiki.txt file gives:
567
